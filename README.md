Waher Colour Scheme For Sublime Text 2
=====================================

This is a syntax highlighting colour scheme for Sublime Text 2, based on the Waher style for Notepad++. THIS SCHEME IS NOT YET RELEASE READY; USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Installation
------------

Clone the repo into your Packages/ folder.  Then, in Sublime Text 2, goto:

  Preferences > Color Scheme > sublime-waher-color-scheme > Waher

to activate the Waher colour scheme.

Feedback, Pull Requests Welcome
-------------------------------

I spend most of my time programming in PHP, so this scheme probably needs some tweaks to look really good in other languages.  Please do send me feedback on how it looks for you, and if you send me a pull request, please remember to tell me which syntax you were looking at when you tweaked it!
